## What is modulepack?

> [!CAUTION]
> modulepack is currently in development. The provided API is subject to change.

By integrating multiple versions of modules into a single universal module, we provide a solution to compatibility issues arising from breaking changes. This allows developers to minimize conflicts that may occur in projects using various versions of modules, enhancing the maintainability of the code. The universal module supports the functionalities of each version while offering users a consistent interface, contributing to an improved development experience.

### This is not a bundler

modulepack is not a bundler. While a bundler aims to bundle multiple modules into a single file, modulepack focuses on combining multiple versions of modules into one module.

## Key features

- **ðŸŽ’ Universal module**: Combines multiple versions of modules into a single module. Create libraries with high version coverage.
- **ðŸŽ­ Version management**: Switch between specific versions or migrate as needed.
- **ðŸ§ª Module Test**: Manage corresponding test codes for multiple versions all at once.
